It has been quite the first year for Team WALK. It was the best of times
<!--more-->
and the worst of times, as Charles Dickens might say. <br><br>

Our team has had its ups and downs, which overall has made it an exciting year. We’ve discovered lots of new directions in which our project could go, but we’ve also had numerous problems seeing those novel ideas become reality. During this time, there has been periods of excitement and frustration. In the end, it turns out that it wasn’t all for nothing. We have just recently decided on a direction for our team: creating a 3-D printer specialized for the mechanics of a prosthesis and optimized to become biologically compatible with the existing limb. As a matter of fact, this idea came up in the past week as I write this, giving our team new energy and life. We are now looking forward to a productive summer of conducting research, adding to our literature review, and growing together as a team.
