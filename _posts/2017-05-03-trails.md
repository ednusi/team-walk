Hey everyone!
	
	<!--more-->

I am happy to say that the team is jumping into a new summer ready to go with an entirely new and advanced project direction. Like Myles mentioned in the last post, weâ€™ve started a new mathematical and biological based project where we divide into two subteams and work on different facets of our research question. The biology team will be getting ready to test bacteria on 3D-printed PLA, unprinted PLA filament and carbon fiber bracelets to understand the microscale interactions of different used-for-prostheses materials with the skin. The engineering team will be handling the statistical analysis of a cartesian printer extruder and building a printer to better understand its different functions and structure. The end of the semester is right around the corner but we are just getting started! Team WALK is back and ready as ever.
Stay tuned for our summer discoveries!
